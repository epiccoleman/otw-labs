This one takes some manual labor because it needed a moderately complex script.

You will need to run the "extractinor" script in the tools directory for this level.

Copy it to a working directory in /tmp and run it to produce the password.

Run ssh -p 2220 bandit${LEVEL_NO}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org to connect to Level 12.
