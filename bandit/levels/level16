This one took a little manual work, not worth automating.

ports=$(nmap -p31000-32000 localhost | grep "[[:digit:]]\{5\}" | grep -v "host is up" | grep -v filtered | cut -d\/ -f1)
for port in ${PORTS[@]}; do echo "$PASSWORD" | openssl s_client -ign_eof -connect localhost:$port; done | grep -A30 "Correct!"

you can then use this key to ssh to localhost as bandit17 and then check /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17

Run ssh -p 2220 bandit${LEVEL_NO}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org to connect
