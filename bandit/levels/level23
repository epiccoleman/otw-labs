You will need to add a script to /var/spool/bandit24 and chmod it so it can be executed by anyone.
The script will run as bandit24 and has access to the bandit24 pw file in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24

My successful script was "cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/epiccoleman24/pw". This depends on having
created that directory and file, and having updated the file to be writable by anyone.

Run ssh -p 2220 bandit${LEVEL_NO}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org to connect...
