This one is pretty interesting!

Run ssh -p 2220 bandit${LEVEL_NO}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org to connect to Level 13.

There is a private key file in the home directory which can be used to connect to the local ssh server as bandit14 like so:

ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost

From here you can run:
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

to get the password for level 14
